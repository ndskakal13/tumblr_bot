# tumblr_bot
a Tumblr bot which will reply to users and learn from what they say to it. (this project is just in its infancy, and I also am new to machine learning.)

*this bot makes use of Jumblr, the Tumblr Java API. you can find its documentation and download the .jar file [here](https://tumblr.github.io/jumblr/).*

*I realize the algorithm used here will not implement a traditional method of AI learning and typical response bots. I will be creating a bot which uses these methods but for my own personal learning I wanted to try this method. As I develop it, I will document it here.*
